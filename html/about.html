                       Vera, the beloved bag and shoe business, was founded by entrepreneur Chandrè Leigh Davids in 2023. Chandrè Leigh Davids, a fashion enthusiast with a passion for sustainability, had always been frustrated by the lack of high-quality, eco-friendly accessories on the market. After years of researching and experimenting with innovative materials, Chandrè finally launched Vera, with a debut collection of handcrafted bags made from repurposed plastic bottles and recycled fabric. The brand quickly gained traction among fashion-conscious consumers who shared Chandrè commitment to sustainability. As Vera's popularity grew, Chandrè expanded her product line to include stylish shoes made from recycled rubber and plant-based materials. Today, Vera is a go-to destination for stylish and eco-friendly accessories, with a loyal following of customers who appreciate the brand's commitment to reducing waste and promoting sustainability.

                    <p class="p3">
                        "I've always had a deep sense of love for most of my interests, but what stuck out to me the most was fashion, music and crafting. I've always felt most like myself when I took time out of my day to feed my interests and as hours turned to days and days turned to months, I decided that I wanted to start my own empire but I didn't know where to start, how to get funded, how to market my business but then I heard this quote "<insert quote>" and I decided that I would think no more, and just do. I had decided that my dream wasnt just a dream, it was a goal. I started working at a company so that I could get money in to start my small craft business called Prettier is Pink, with which I sold bows and bouquets and started gaining knowledge on how to market myself to people and potential sponsors. I genuinely didn't know what I was doing and how the business would turn out in the long run and i honestly felt like giving up until I met Coach Matika and he genuinely altered my Brain chemistry. He talked about the (Be Can Do Have strategy) which is essence is if u want to be, you must be willing to can and if you can you must be Disciplined to do and once you do, you can have and once you have YOU CAN BE. I'll be honest, starting my small business was a very rough and slow start but I eventually picked up a steady pace in terms of sales and I found myself getting recognition from local churches and my businesses has been flourishing ever since. So essentially I started a small business on a whim not knowing how any of it would play out then used the profit to fund my new project, VERA. 

                        What I've learnt from this and what I would like to bring unto you is that you shouldn't think too much about the what if an what if not's, just do it and stay committed and see what happens. 

                        My advice to young entrepreneurs is that they shouldn't lower the value of their products to please potential customers, because with every ONE bad review come two more positive ones. So if you're thinking of starting a business. Just do it. "
